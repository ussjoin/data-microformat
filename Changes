Revision history for Data-Microformat

0.02	Date?
		Bugfixes:
			Added support for "psychotic" encodings, a la 
				http://hcard.geekhood.net/encode/ .
			Fixed nested vcards discarding their secondary class, as in
			t/08nested.t.
		New Features:
			Now using HTML::Element for dumping the hCards out, so we get nicer
				formatting and easier output, essentially for free (no extra
				dependencies).
			Added to_text, to return a plaintext representation of an hCard.
