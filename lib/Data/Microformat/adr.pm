Data::Microformat::adr - A module to parse and create adrs

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Data::Microformat::adr version 0.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Microformat::adr;

	my $adr = Data::Microformat::adr->parse($a_web_page);

	print "The street address we found in this adr was:\n";
	print $adr->street_address."\n";

	# To create a new adr:
	my $new_adr = Data::Microformat::adr->new;
	$new_adr->street_address("548 4th St.");
	$new_adr->locality("San Francisco");
	$new_adr->region("CA");
	$new_adr->postal_code("94107");
	$new_adr->country_name("USA");

	print "Here's the new adr I've just made:\n";
	print $new_adr->to_hcard."\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An adr is the address microformat used primarily in hCards. It exists as its
own separate specification.

This module exists both to parse existing adrs from web pages, and to create
new adrs so that they can be put onto the Internet.

To use it to parse an existing adr (or adrs), simply give it the content
of the page containing them (there is no need to first eliminate extraneous
content, as the module will handle that itself):

	my $adr = Data::Microformat::adr->parse($content);

If you would like to get all the adrs on the webpage, simply ask using an
array:

	my @adrs = Data::Microformat::adr->parse($content);

To create a new adr, first create the new object:
	
	my $adr = Data::Microformat::adr->new;
	
Then use the helper methods to add any data you would like. When you're ready
to output the adr in the hCard HTML format, simply write

	my $output = $adr->to_hcard;

And $output will be filled with an hCard representation, using <div> tags
exclusively with the relevant class names.
